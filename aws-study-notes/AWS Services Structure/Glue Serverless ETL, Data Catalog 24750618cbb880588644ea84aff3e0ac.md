# Glue: Serverless ETL, Data Catalog.

- **What is it? (1-Sentence Pitch):** A fully managed, **serverless** data integration service that discovers your data, transforms it, and makes it available for search and querying via a central Data Catalog.
- **Core Use Cases:** Running serverless ETL jobs to clean, enrich, and move data. Automatically discovering data schemas and populating the AWS Glue Data Catalog to enable querying with Athena and Redshift Spectrum.
- **Key Distinction:** Choose **Glue** for serverless, managed ETL and data cataloging, especially for common data transformation tasks. Choose **EMR** when you need more control, custom libraries, or long-running jobs on a persistent cluster using specific big data frameworks like Spark or Hadoop.
