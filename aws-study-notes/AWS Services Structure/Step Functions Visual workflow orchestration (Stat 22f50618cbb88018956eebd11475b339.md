# Step Functions: Visual workflow orchestration (State Machine).

- **What is it? (1-Sentence Pitch):** A serverless function orchestrator that makes it easy to sequence multiple AWS services into visual workflows.
- **Core Use Cases:** For complex, multi-step business processes that require state, retries, and branching logic (e.g., an e-commerce order processing workflow).
