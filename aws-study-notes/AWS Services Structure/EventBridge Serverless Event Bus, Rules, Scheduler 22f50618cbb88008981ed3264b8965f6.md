# EventBridge: Serverless Event Bus, Rules, Scheduler.

- **What is it? (1-Sentence Pitch):** A serverless event bus that makes it easy to connect applications together using data from your own apps, third-party SaaS applications, and AWS services.
- **Core Use Cases:** Building event-driven architectures where services react to events from many different sources, not just your own.
- **Key Distinction:** An evolution of CloudWatch Events. It uses the same API but adds advanced features like schema registry and integrations with SaaS partners. Think of it as the central nervous system for event-driven applications.
