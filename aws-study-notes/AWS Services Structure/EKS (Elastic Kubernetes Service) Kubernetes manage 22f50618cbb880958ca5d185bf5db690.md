# EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Kubernetes management.

- **What is it? (1-Sentence Pitch):** A managed service that makes it easy to run the open-source Kubernetes container orchestration system on AWS.
- **Core Use Cases:**
    - For organizations that are already using Kubernetes or want to use the open-source Kubernetes ecosystem and tooling.
    - Migrating on-premises Kubernetes workloads to AWS.
- **Key Distinction:** **EKS vs. ECS:** Choose **EKS** if you need Kubernetes compatibility (portability, community tools). Choose **ECS** if you want a simpler, AWS-native, and deeply integrated solution.
