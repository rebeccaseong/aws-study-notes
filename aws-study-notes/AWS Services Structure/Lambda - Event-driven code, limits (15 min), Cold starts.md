- **What is it? (1-Sentence Pitch):** A serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events without you needing to manage any servers.
- **Core Use Cases:**
    - Event-driven data processing (e.g., process an image when it's uploaded to S3).
    - Building backend APIs for web/mobile apps (via API Gateway).
    - Scheduled tasks (via EventBridge/CloudWatch Events).
- **Key Features & Concepts:**
    - **Event-Driven:** A function is triggered by an event source (S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, etc.).
    - **Serverless:** No servers to provision or manage. AWS handles scaling, patching, and availability.
    - **Configuration:** You only configure memory, which also allocates proportional CPU. Max timeout is 15 minutes.
    - **Concurrency:** The number of executions of your function that can run simultaneously.
- **Integration:**
    - The "glue" of AWS; integrates with over 200 AWS services.
    - Often triggered by **S3, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB Streams, and API Gateway**.
    - Writes logs to **CloudWatch Logs**.
    - Can be orchestrated by **Step Functions**.
