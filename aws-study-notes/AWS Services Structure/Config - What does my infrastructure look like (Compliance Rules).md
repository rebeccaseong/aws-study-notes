- **What is it? (1-Sentence Pitch):** A service that lets you assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources over time.
- **Core Use Cases:**
    - Continuously monitoring for compliance with your desired configurations.
    - Getting a history of configuration changes for a resource.
    - Answering questions like, "Show me all S3 buckets that are publicly accessible."
- **Key Distinction:** **CloudTrail** tells you *who* made a change. **Config** tells you *what* the configuration of the resource looked like before and after the change and if it's compliant.
