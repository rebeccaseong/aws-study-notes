- **What is it? (1-Sentence Pitch):** Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps identify security vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices in your AWS workloads (EC2 instances, container images, Lambda functions).

- **Core Use Cases:**
    - Continuous vulnerability scanning of EC2 instances and container images
    - Identifying unintended network exposure
    - Scanning for CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
    - Compliance validation (CIS benchmarks, PCI DSS)
    - DevSecOps integration (scan container images in CI/CD pipelines)

- **Key Features & Concepts:**
    - **Automated Scanning:** Continuously scans for vulnerabilities (no manual intervention)
    - **Agentless Scanning (EC2):** Uses AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) for EC2 scans
    - **Container Image Scanning:** Scans images in Amazon ECR for vulnerabilities
    - **Lambda Function Scanning:** Scans Lambda function code and dependencies
    - **Risk Scoring:** Prioritizes findings based on severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
    - **Integration with Security Hub:** Centralizes findings across AWS accounts
    - **Automated Remediation:** Can trigger automated fixes via EventBridge + Lambda

- **What Inspector Scans For:**
    1. **EC2 Instances:**
        - Software vulnerabilities (CVEs)
        - Network reachability issues (unintended exposure)
        - CIS operating system configuration benchmarks
    2. **Container Images (ECR):**
        - Known vulnerabilities in OS packages and programming language packages
    3. **Lambda Functions:**
        - Vulnerabilities in code dependencies and Lambda layers

- **How Inspector Works:**
    1. **Enable Inspector** in your AWS account
    2. **Automatic Discovery:** Inspector automatically discovers EC2, ECR, Lambda resources
    3. **Continuous Scanning:** Scans run continuously (no scheduled scans needed)
    4. **Findings:** Inspector generates findings with severity scores and remediation recommendations
    5. **EventBridge Integration:** Send findings to EventBridge for automated response

- **Inspector vs GuardDuty vs Macie vs Config:**
    | **Service** | **What It Does** | **Focus Area** |
    |---|---|---|
    | **Inspector** | **Vulnerability scanning** (EC2, containers, Lambda) | **Security vulnerabilities, CVEs** |
    | **GuardDuty** | **Threat detection** (analyze logs) | **Malicious activity, anomalies** |
    | **Macie** | **Data discovery** (PII in S3) | **Sensitive data protection** |
    | **Config** | **Configuration compliance** | **Resource configuration rules** |

- **Integration:**
    - **EC2:** Uses AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) for scanning
    - **ECR:** Automatically scans container images on push
    - **Lambda:** Scans Lambda function code and layers
    - **EventBridge:** Trigger automated remediation workflows based on findings
    - **Security Hub:** Centralize Inspector findings across accounts
    - **CloudWatch:** Monitor Inspector metrics

- **Exam Tips / What to Remember:**
    - **Inspector = Vulnerability scanning** for EC2, containers (ECR), and Lambda
    - Exam scenario: **"Scan EC2 instances for vulnerabilities"** = Inspector
    - **Continuous scanning** (not scheduled or manual)
    - **Risk scoring** helps prioritize remediation (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
    - **Agentless for EC2** (uses SSM Agent, which is likely already installed)
    - **GuardDuty detects threats** (malicious activity), **Inspector finds vulnerabilities** (CVEs)
    - **Macie finds PII** in S3, **Inspector scans for software vulnerabilities**
    - Can integrate with **EventBridge** for automated remediation (e.g., patch EC2 via Lambda)
    - Scans **ECR container images** automatically when pushed
